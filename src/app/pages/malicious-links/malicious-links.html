    <p>
      Malicious links are URLs designed to steal information, install malware, or 
      trick you into revealing sensitive data. They often appear in emails, text 
      messages, social media, and fake websites.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Check the URL carefully:</strong> Look for misspellings or extra 
        characters (e.g., "amaz0n.com" instead of "amazon.com")
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Hover before clicking:</strong> On desktop, hover over links to see 
        the actual destination URL
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Look for HTTPS:</strong> Legitimate sites use HTTPS, especially for 
        login or payment pages
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Shortened URLs:</strong> Be cautious with bit.ly, tinyurl.com, etc. - 
        use URL expanders to see the real destination
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Suspicious senders:</strong> Unexpected emails or messages from unknown 
        sources containing links
      </li>
    </ul>
